          <h3 id="history"> My name is Victor Fernandez, born and raised in the Dominican Republic.
          When I was kid I used to play baseball all the times since I was
          5 years old with my friends. Since I was litle I like math and computers
          and all new technologies. Also, I never like my class of writting. My curiosity
          technology becomes to awake after I passed 8th grade and I started using
          computers and started wondering how things work, what was an operating system,
          how smart phones were made and design. Then I started learning programming language.
          The first programming language I learned was visual basic.
